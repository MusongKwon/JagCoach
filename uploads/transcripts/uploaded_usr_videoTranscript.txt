 Raise your hand if you speak another language out of the English. Okay, now raise your hand if English is not your first language. Okay, a few hands up. So according to the 2021 census, nearly one in four Canadians are immigrants or permanent residents. That means that almost 25% of Canada's population are foreign-born. While Canada celebrates individuals diverse cultures and ethnicities, people who immigrate to Canada may still experience a culture-ration. A culture-ration is the graduate process where one adapts to a new cultural environment, upon relocating from their heritage culture to a new and prevailing host culture in which one hour resides. Well, inculturation is when one maintains their heritage cultures' values and traditions. Immigrants usually integrate themselves into their new host culture by adopting the values and traditions from the new host culture while still maintaining some of the values and traditions from their heritage culture. Now, first language loss, or L1 loss, is a documented phenomenon that happens when individuals progressively lose their first language. And this is especially common among those who relocate to a country that speaks a foreign language that differs from their first language. Research has shown that the loss of first language proficiency has detrimental consequences, such as a loss of culture and ethnic identity. Therefore, my thesis aimed to look at prominent factors such as a culture-ration that may be related to first language loss and inculturation, which may relate to first language retention. For this study, we had 177 undergraduate students complete a series of surveys that measure their English vocabulary size, levels of acculturation to the host culture, and language dominance. This depends also completed a 101 Zoom session that looked at their language proficiency in both their first language and in English. We found that the more acculturated a person is, the lower their first language skills are. However, they did have higher English language proficiency. On the contrary, inculturation is related to individual's first language maintenance, belower English outcomes. We also looked at whether residing a multigenerational household will help individuals preserve their first language. However, we did not find any significant result that supported that claim. The findings of the present study highlights the importance of acculturation and first language loss. Implaining that higher levels of acculturation is associated with lower levels of first language proficiency. While it's important to acquire the new dominant language of the society and adopt the values and traditions from the host culture, it's also critical to meet you once first language and heritage culture as well. Thank you.

 Green of my small community, I saw the poor stressed out because they had no food, no money, or taking care of sick loved ones. After I invested education, I moved to a big city. I saw the rich also stressed out because of business failures, social pressures. It dawned on me that stress is the universal human problem irrespective of social structure. It started at the year the university has shown that stress has the power to reduce the lifespan of an individual. This implies that the more we avoid stress or fight it off, the higher our chances to live to a full life span. The World Health Organization has predicted that by the year 2030, stress-related illnesses will be the leading cause of world disability that seven years from today, how prepared are we? How do we combat stress? We need a solution that is accessible, available, and affordable by everyone in the world, from the developing nation to the developed nation. In my research, I employed at Fial Intelligence and positive emotion to fight our stress. How did we do this? We developed an app that induces the release of repeptized in the body. Repeptized and molecules that helps the body fight our stress naturally. This app was built with gaming elements and persuasive techniques to ensure that users beam a smile in the first four or five seconds of use. Users are expected to move objects around and align them appropriately with their smile and unlock messages from users across the world with their smile. To measure the impact of this app, we recruited users and participants from people across the world over 100 participants within an outside Canada to use this app in their natural environment. And the feedback we've been getting during this ongoing study has indicated the positive impact of this app. What is our mission? Our mission is to give everyone an Earth the power to fight back stress without medication, without therapeutic appointment, and at zero cost. We know that not everyone can afford medication, not everyone can afford therapy, but every human being on Earth can smile. Thank you.
